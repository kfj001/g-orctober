*reading the readme, how provocative...*

A godot project asset demonstrating an old school "beat-em-up" or brawler genre game ala *Altered Beast*, or *Golden Axe*. G-orctober features:

- Vibrant 2D graphics made in *Inkscape*
- Parallax scrolling background
- 8-bit chiptune sound fx made with *bfxr*
- On-screen controls for mobile/touchscreen devices
- Gamepad support (in addition to Keyboard)
- an Orc

Play as an Orc venturing through the Red Forest as you slaughter the hordes of **ZOMBIE GNOMES**! WHOMP 'em with your trusty mace, or leap into the air and land with a MIGHTY STOMP to deflect hordes of ankle biting undead.

# How to Play

# a brief history of G-Orctober...
This project went through some phases.

## Original idea:

Use free orc asset for adventure slasher where food makes you fatter and uh... More powerful? It would Use free orc asset on unity store. Study vector art for deconstructive reproduction. Procedurally dropped enemies. Kine rigged? As a style. Leverage as many Free assets as possible.

## Second iteration
So I studied cartoon design, animation, illustration and picked up some open source tools like Inkscape to do the art. 

Horny fetish orc travels through beat em up stages. Stage 1: The Red Forest - Gainerism. Beat up the zombie gnomes. Get food power ups. Gain weight. Get fatter and attacks do more damage and you have more health points. Also you move slower.

Unity scrapped in favor of fully open source tech tree; Inkscape, Godot, Kritia. Wanna take to linux dev env but impractical.

Additional stages to explore fetishes as I decide. 

## Final Addendum
Yes this was going to be an adult oriented videogame! And a pretty agressively gay one too, I mean the entire 1980s brawler genre was just a wasteland of homoeroticism tbh, so this would've fit in just fine.

In the end, a Linux open source game dev workstation was not only *practical* but once the kinks were worked out fun and reliable, and not just for game making but all sorts of maker tasks; 3D modeling & printing work too!

But I just don't have the time for this specifically anymore.

Dave (my husband) got thoroughly crippled by his fat, I'm disinclined to continue to make the stage about gainerism, and I only got as far as getting a competent beat-em-up engine and graphics anyhow. SO since I'm now Dave's sole caretaker and don't have time to finish this project, I'm just gonna give the mostly fully working beat-em-up stage and graphics with some minor polishing to the Godot community as a project resource. Anyone can download it and be inspired by it. From what I've seen of the godot project assets, it'll be one of the nicer 2D ones... Ultimately where I really wanted to take this was, keep the beat-em-up engine (and the horny) and use it as the "combat screen" in a greater RPG style game (cause of course we're going there LOL) Well it's mine and I can still do that, and now others can too.
